# Mapping Earthquakes Challenge
### Create Interactive Earthquake Map in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the Earth.

In this challenge, I added a third map style as an additional tile layer. I also added tectonic plate GeoJSON data to the map to illustrate the relationship between the location and frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates using Leaflet library, JavaScript, HTML, and Mapbox.

This is the picture of the final result
